## Experimental Programming 实验编程

实验编程（2016-2026）是一个围绕科技与艺术的先锋社群与知识平台，连接全球跨界实验者，起源于2010年代国内最活跃的交互媒体艺术论坛HUDOIT。作为前沿创作范式策源地，实验编程长期受邀为多所高校输出教学方案与技术支持（包括央美、同济、清华等），聚焦人工智能、交互媒体与生成艺术的实践探索与知识传播。

Experimental Programming (2016-2026) is a pioneering community and knowledge platform centered around technology and art, connecting cross-disciplinary experimenters worldwide. It originated from HUDOIT, China's most active interactive media art forum in the 2010s. As a source of  cutting-edge creative paradigms, it has long been invited to provide teaching solutions and technical support to many universities (including the CAFA, Tongji, Tsinghua, etc.), focusing on the practical exploration and knowledge dissemination of artificial intelligence, interactive media, and generative art.
